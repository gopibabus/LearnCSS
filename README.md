## Why CSS?

With CSS, we are able to create rules, and apply those rules to many elements within the website. This approach offers many advantages when site-wide changes are required by a client. Since the content is completely separated from the design, we can make those changes in our Style Sheet and have it effect every applicable instance.

- CSS Provides Efficiency in Design and Updates
- CSS Use Can Lead To Faster Page Downloads.
- CSS is Easy to Work With
- Avoid duplication
- Make maintenance easier
